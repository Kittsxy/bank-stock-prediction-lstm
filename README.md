# 📈 LSTM-Based Stock Forecasting: Indonesia's Top 4 Banks

This project uses an LSTM neural network to forecast the stock prices of four major Indonesian banks: BBCA, BBRI, BMRI, and BBNI. The model leverages historical data to predict future price trends, offering insights for long-term investment prospects.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Yahoo Finance API

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. LSTM model training and tuning
3. Price forecasting and visualization
4. Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE

## 📁 Files
- `stock_forecasting_lstm.ipynb`: The main notebook
- `bbca_predicted_plot.png`: Sample visualization
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages

## 🚀 Key Insights
BBCA and BMRI showed the most promising long-term trends based on both forecasted prices and strong fundamentals. BBNI showed higher fluctuations, suggesting greater market risk.
